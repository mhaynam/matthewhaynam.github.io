## Matthew Haynam's Data Science Portfolio ##
A portfolio of projects representing the skills that I have acquired over the years. I am still adding to my toolbelt and will continue to do so, as there is always more to learn. That is what makes this field worth the pursuit. Feel free to reach out. I love to talk data science, because it can only make each of us better.
